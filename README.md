# Deep Retweet
Using deep learning and word2vec to do retweet prediction

**Note** This is a *very* early build. Expect documentation, code, etc to be incomplete.

##Idea

Retweet prediction is a fairly well studied problem, but it's generally based on "traditional" NLP (bag of words, parse trees, etc.) Let's try building some deep learning models and see how well they do.

##Motivation

Retweeting behavior seems to be similar to ad clicks: both indicate that the user is interested in the topic, both are short lived and competing with many other messages, a higher response rate is generally preferred, and retweet rates / click through rates are generally low. The big difference is that Tweets are very standardized and openly available.
